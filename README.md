# memez

This is a fun chrome extension that turns all images, videos, and iframes on the current screen to memes! We select a random meme, format it to your screen (ok fine, we use MemeGen API for this), and then replace an image! 

Non-spicy page without memes: 

<img src = "bland.png"> 

Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️  Page with dank memes: 

<img src = "spicy.png>

The memes are not guaranteed to be PG, but none of them are extremely explicit. All are very funny!

This project was also meant to give me an introduction in to building chrome extensions and working with HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript (awesome language, btw).

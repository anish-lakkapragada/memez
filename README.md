# pallonizer

This is a fun chrome extension that turns all images, videos, and iframes on the current screen to pallone memes (from the r/pallone subreddit)! We select a random meme, format it to your screen with Reddit API, and then replace an image! 

Non-spicy page without memes:

**SPICY 🌶️🌶️🌶️  PAGE WITH DANK MEMES**:

This project was also meant to give me an introduction in to building chrome extensions and working with HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript (awesome language, btw).
